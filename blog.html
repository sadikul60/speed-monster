                <p><strong>Difference between LocalStorage and SessionStorage:</strong> LocalStorage is a property that allows JavaScript sites and apps to save key-value pairs in a web browser with no expiration date. This means the data stored in the browser will persist even after the browser window is closed. <br><br> The sessionStorage object stores data only for a session. It means that the data stored in the sessionStorage will be deleted when the browser is closed. A page session lasts as long as the web browser is open and survives over the page refresh. <br><br> sessionStorage is similar to localStorage ; the difference is that while data in localStorage doesn't expire, data in sessionStorage is cleared when the page session ends. Whenever a document is loaded in a particular tab in the browser, a unique page session gets created and assigned to that particular tab.</p>

                <p><strong>Difference between Global scope and Block scope:</strong> The Javascript global scope is the context where everything in a Javascript program executes by default. This scope includes all variables, objects, and references that are not contained within a customized scope defined by a programmer. Global scope is the entire Javascript execution environment. <br><br> Block Level Scope: This scope restricts the variable that is declared inside a specific block, from access by the outside of the block. The let & const keyword facilitates the variables to be block scoped. <br><br> Function Scope: When a variable is declared inside a function, it is only accessible within that function and cannot be used outside that function. Block Scope: A variable when declared inside the if or switch conditions or inside for or while loops, are accessible within that particular condition or loop.</p>
